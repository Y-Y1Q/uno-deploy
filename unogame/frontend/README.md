# Getting Started with Frontend

NOTE: THIS README.md only works for that deprecated Frontend folder which might not work after being run

## Build and start frontend server

`cd unogame/frontend`: change directory to frontend folder from repo root

`npm install`: install dependencies

`npm run build`: build (compiles and bundles) the frontend for production

`npm run dev`: starts Vite development server for live development

`npm run format`: utilizes Prettier to format code within the ./src directory, **run this before a commit**

Port: 5173 or defined locally
